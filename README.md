# Recipes Project

This project is my first project on TOP(Odin). The project is aimed at demonstrating my grasp of HTML concepts. In this project, I am creating a simple recipe website that will have a couple of webpages. This pages will be presented in a structured way and will have titles, images, list of ingredients and steps to follow.
 At the end of this project, I would hope to have demonstrated some skills which includes:

 ## Skills;

 - Build and structure HTML documents.
 - Use semantic HTML elements effectively.
 - link multiple pages within a website.

 I am excited to be undertaking this project and I hope for the best in my quest to become a seasoned developer.
